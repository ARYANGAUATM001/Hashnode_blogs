1. Data Science is all about - - &gt; **Observing --&gt; Analyzing --&gt; Reacting.**
    
    As in real life, we observe people analyze their behaviour and then react in a specific way. As our behaviour towards children is really different from our behaviour towards our friends. So, what we do here is, we analyze historical behaviour and react according to that.
